# mod trcker

this was made for my friends server to keep track of all the mods in his discord server,
it basically has 2 functions: addd mod and show mods

to add mod:

.add_mod <tag the staff> <rank of the staff>
  
to show mods:
  
.show_mods

it uses csv files to add the mods and show the mods and you can make some cahnges to the code and when the 
show mods command is used, it pings all the mods, by some adjustments you can not make that happen.
if your mods are always mad, you use .split() or .replace() function

this full code is written and compatible with python >= 3.8

csv files are more flexible then json thats just my point of view so i use csv file
this can also be found on my repl 


this bot was made under 30 minutes, after 2 days of development it was realesed in the server, 
hope this helps out and some code is written in funny way  
i will try my best to make it logical but if you go to my repl you can see it was written in a funny manner

that was just because there was a lot of stress and wanted to make somethings cooler and thats all
hope you like it and it helps out in some way for you!

the code is written in discord.py rewrite.
